If the features in the dataset are on different scales, those with larger ranges can disproportionately influence the distance calculations, leading to biased clustering results. For example, if one feature ranges from 0 to 1 and another from 0 to 1000, the second feature will dominate the distance computations, potentially overshadowing the contributions of the first feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: The cold-start problem occurs when a recommender system cannot draw inferences about new users or items due to the absence of prior interaction data. This is especially prominent in collaborative filtering, which relies on user interactions to make recommendations. Without historical data, the system struggles to identify patterns and preferences[2].\n",

    "   - **New Item**: Newly added items lack user interaction history, making them difficult to recommend.\n",
    "   - **New Community**: In a completely new system, both users and items are untested, leading to a lack of data for recommendations[2][3].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison with Other Techniques**:\n",
    "   - **Content-Based Filtering**: This method does not face the same cold-start issues because it relies on the features of items rather than user interactions. It can recommend items based on their attributes even if no prior data exists.\n",
